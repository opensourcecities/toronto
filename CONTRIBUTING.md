# Contribution Guide

You can add a record using any of the following three methods. We have a few methods because this list is displayed both as Markdown on GitHub and on our website.

- Complete PR
  - add record in [README](https://github.com/opensourcecities/toronto/blob/master/README.md) AND
  - add record's `yml` file (based on [Type of Records](#type-of-records)) in `data` folder
- Partial PR
  - add record in [README](https://github.com/opensourcecities/toronto/blob/master/README.md) OR
  - add record's `yml` file (based on [Type of Records](#type-of-records)) in `data` folder
- Addition Request
  - [Open a new issue](https://github.com/RichardLitt/open-source-toronto/issues/new) and provide information for the record you want to add

> Note that if you want to send a "Partial PR" you need to check **Allow edits from maintainers** checkbox while creating the PR, so that we will be able to complete the PR and merge it.
